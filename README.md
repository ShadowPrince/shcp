# shcp

I've been having some fun making command intepretator built with clojure and JNI (_Clojure -> Java -> JNI -> C++ lib -> posix libs -> system calls_). Proudly named __Shellception__.

## Installation

* `make` in _java/bin_
* `lein uberjar` in _._

## Usage

No practical usage.

    $ java -Djava.library.path=java/bin -jar target/shcp*jar
